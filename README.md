# lamp-stack-in-docker
LAMP stack in docker. which just works. Simple and clean docker composer file.

## To make it work in your local machine:
 
Just update line: 6, replace `/app/path/in/host/pc` with your application directory

I assumed your local IP `172.19.0.0` is available.

In case if this is availed, just change `19`'s to another number which is available ( that must be greater than 1 and less than 255).
